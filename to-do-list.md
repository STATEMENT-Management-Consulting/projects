### **Project Description: To-Do List Application**

#### **Overview**
The To-Do List Application is a productivity tool designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. With an intuitive user interface and robust backend support, the application allows users to create, edit, complete, and delete tasks seamlessly. The design, inspired by a modern and minimalist approach, enhances user engagement and ensures accessibility. 

#### **Features**
##### **Frontend (React)**
- **User Authentication:** Users can register, log in, and securely manage their accounts.
- **Task Management:** 
  - Add new tasks with descriptions and optional deadlines.
  - Edit tasks to update details.
  - Mark tasks as completed or pending.
  - Delete tasks.
- **Categorization and Filtering:**
  - Organize tasks into categories (e.g., Work, Personal, Urgent).
  - Filter tasks by status (e.g., Completed, Pending).
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile users.
- **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes for enhanced usability.

##### **Backend (Node.js with Express)**
- **API Endpoints:** Provide RESTful endpoints for tasks and user management:
  - `/tasks`: Handle CRUD operations for tasks.
  - `/auth`: Manage user authentication (login, registration, logout).
- **Database Integration:** Store data securely in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB).
- **Validation and Security:**
  - Input validation to ensure data integrity.
  - Secure password storage using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
  - Authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Real-Time Updates (Optional):** Use WebSocket or libraries like `Socket.IO` to provide real-time updates for collaborative task management.
